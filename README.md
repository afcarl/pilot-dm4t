# DM4T Pilot

DM4T (Data Management for TEDDINET using Semantic Technologies) is a project to investigate frameworks for data management in (physical) science research.  The repository is an issue tracker for a [Frictionless Data](http://frictionlessdata.io/) pilot project to understand the extent to which the [Data Package](http://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) concepts could be usefully applied.
